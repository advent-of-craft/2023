## Day 1: code that is easy to understand.

Welcome to the Advent of Craft 2023.

We begin this journey by going over the basics. 
We all do this everyday:

_Reading a simple code._ 

If you understand a piece of code quickly, 
it does not mean the code is readable much less well-crafted.
It also does not mean the code should not be refactored.

A readable code is not always the fewest line or the one 
that uses the latest framework technique.

Think about the real value your code should bring.

May the crafting journey begin!
