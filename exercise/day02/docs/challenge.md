## Day 2: Fight indentation.

On the second day of your crafting journey, you are to meet your first fizzbuzz code. 
You probably know this piece of code and yet there is so much in it to unpack.

Today though your task is but a simple one: reducing the complexity of the code
by removing as much indentation as you can.

_Remember that a developer never forgets his craft. He just adds to it._

>**Challenge of day 2: Your code can only have one level of indentation.**

May your journey continue!

- <u>💡HINT:</u> Apply what you learned on day 1
