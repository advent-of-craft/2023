## Day 3: Work on cognition.

Third day of your journey. Today, we keep working on simplifying a code but
the approach is different. Think of what is cognitively better.

The code you are about to embark is simple, yet something makes it hard to 
read it at first.

While not overly difficult, today is about housekeeping. Today is about
doing the extra effort to make a code more maintainable.

Remember what the old developers say...

_A code can always be improved._

May the crafting journey continue!
