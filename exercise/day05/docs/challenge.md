## Day 5: One too many loop.

Today, you were set to depart from the Testing Islands but your ship is 
in great need of some repairs.

As is the code of today. You already know the exercise as it's a continuation
of day 3. You will continue the housekeeping work by eliminating more complexity.

Today, you will clean any loops that are not needed.

_No loop is better than too many loops._

>**Challenge of day 5: No "for" loop authorized.**

May your crafting journey continue!

- <u>💡HINT:</u> IDE + undo can help you.
