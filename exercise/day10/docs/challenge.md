## Day 10: Love your code without conditions.

Today, you are still repairing codes. You've been fighting faulty loops.
And you realize there might be more to it than you thought possible.

Maybe, you can go one step further and try to also remove unwanted conditions.

You will take the code of day 6 and applied what you've learned to a new level.

The point of today's exercise is to ask ourselves a simple question:

_What is my code trying to achieve?_

>**Challenge of day 10: Dot not use "if" statement.**

May your crafting journey continue!

- <u>💡HINT:</u> Think of the commonality in your conditions.
