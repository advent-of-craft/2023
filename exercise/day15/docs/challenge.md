You need to protect your crew at all costs.

How can you protect your code from changes.

You will need to change it, adapt it but how can you make sure it
never breaks.

Remember a golden rule to be 100% confident in any refactoring:

_Your code needs to be tested_

> **Challenge of day 15: Put a code under tests.**

May you be protected on your crafting journey!
