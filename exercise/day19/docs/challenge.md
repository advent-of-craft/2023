## Day 19: Loosing up dead weight.

Today, you embark on the last few days of your journey.
You have been warned a big storm is brewing your way but home you go.

You will need to leave up extra weight and tighten up the ship 
for the days to come.

The exercise of today deals with exception, again.

You are starting to know the formula. No more exceptions.

This time, the approach might be a bit different.

> **Challenge of day 19: No more exception authorized - use a custom Error.**

May your crafting journey continue!

- <u>💡HINT:</u> What object can you return to get the error state?
