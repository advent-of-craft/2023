## Day 20: A game of dice.

Today, you are hitting the storm and it's much bigger than anticipated.

You have to navigate carefully in order to avoid the worst of it.
A simple mistake can be costly.

Today's exercise is about insuring safe states in your main logic.

You now know how to remove exception but ensuring a safe state is 
another thing. 

_It's all about protection of your code_ 

> **Challenge of day 20: No more exceptions in our domain.**

> You are not allowed to extend the output of the methods (by returning a monadic container) as yesterday... You need to find another way to solve it 🤔

May your crafting journey be safe!

- <u>💡HINT:</u> What triggers the unsafe state here?
