## Day 24: The celebration night.

Your last battle was a full victory, and you are ready to celebrate with
your kingdom. A big celebration is being prepared.

Today is about indulgence, excess and feast.

On today's challenge, the last thing you want is to think about your craft and
as such, the point of the exercise is to increase complexity of the code.

Yes, you heard right.

Using the [`Crappy-Driven Development`](https://github.com/ythirion/crappy-driven-development) technique, you have to make your
code the crappiest possible.
